Overlay is a browser extension that helps developers evaluate open source packages before picking them. It gathers data from various sources, such as [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor/), [Debricked](http://debricked.com/select/), [Socket.dev](http://socket.dev/), and [Deps.dev](https://deps.dev/), and displays them on the package pages of popular registries like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [PyPI](http://pypi.org/), and [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/).

With Overlay, you can quickly consider packages based on metrics like popularity, quality, security, maintenance, and compatibility. You can also see detailed information about each package, such as its license, dependencies, vulnerabilities, issues, releases, and more.

Overlay aims to help developers make informed decisions when choosing open source packages for their projects.

### Currently supported

- **Websites:** [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29461831), [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) and [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) (see [Issue #14](https://github.com/os-scar/overlay/issues/14) for future plans)
- **Registries:** NPM, PYPI and Go (only on `pkg.go.dev`)
- **Advisories:** [Debricked](https://debricked.com/select/), [Snyk](https://snyk.io/advisor/), [Socket](http://socket.dev/) and [DepsDev](https://deps.dev/)

## Installation

Overlay is available for Chrome and Firefox. You can install it from the following links:

- [Chrome Web Store][Chrome]
- [Firefox Add-ons][Mozilla]

## Usage

After installing Overlay, you can use it on any supported page (such as StackOverflow). You will notice indicators on package names and links, showing the number of issues. When you hover over an indicator, you will see more details about the package. You can also click on the indicator to open a modal with even more details.

### Technical details

Overlay is written in Vue.js and uses a **background script** to fetch package data from various external sources.  
It injects the **indicator** as a _WebComponent_ into the current web pages and uses a **popup menu** to control the displayed sources.

### Local Development

To start developing the extension locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project from the repository.
1. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`.
1. In one terminal, run `yarn build:watch`. This will rebuild the extension every time you change a file.
1. In another terminal, run `yarn start:chrome` (or `yarn start:firefox`). This will reload the extension on the development browser every time the extension is built.

You can now test and debug the extension on _Chrome_ or _Firefox_.
